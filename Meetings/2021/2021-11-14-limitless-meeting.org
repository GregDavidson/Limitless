* A Limitless Fellowship - Meeting Notes - 10:00 a.m. Sunday 14 November 2021

** Announcement posted to #general
 
 Shall we talk about the source of our being?  Or Deep Rationality?  Or?

** Followup Post

I want to exuberantly thank everyone who participated in today's Limitless
Fellowship meeting. Different people joined at different times and were only
able to stay for different amounts of time. But the churn was slow, causing the
conversation to somewhat resemble a relay race. The concepts which were
introduced early were advanced and enriched as the torch was passed. What a
glorious adventure! I'll try to write up some of what we covered later and
please chime in with what I've missed before it all fades from our minds!
 
** Some of what we talked about

We began with check-ins and then a critique of models of /Western Rationality/
which fail to analyze the source of the goals being pursued by agents, treating
them all as end-goals. This contrasts with, e.g. NVC, Zen Buddhism, etc. This
led to a discussion of agents as conscious /subjects/ rather than as mechanistic
/objects/ and we were off to the races!
   
Models of Consciousness and their problems
- the Cartesian all or nothing model
- variations in levels of consciousness
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism][Panpsychism]] and its Combination Problem
- Relationship to human language

Meaning seems to always require an interpreter
- [[https://duckduckgo.com/?t=lm&q=computer+made+of+dominoes&atb=v33-1&ia=web][Computers made of Dominoes]]
- Who interprets the interpreter --> an infinite regress
- Can we interpret one another?
- Could Consciousness ground meaning perceived by /subjects?/

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading][Mind Uploading]] and non-digital content or exotic mechanisms
- Evolution occurs in /the Real World/
      - Distinct from the world described by our current physics models
      - Penrose's conjecture of new physics in evolved nervous systems

Possible roles for consciousness
- Grounds meaning perceived by conscious agents
- Source of true creativity
      - the ability to distinguish new domains into existence
- Access to Abstract (Platonic) spaces

Hybrid analog/digital systems
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_computer][In Analog and Hybrid Computers]]
- In animal nervous systems
- long tails in the analog part of a computation
      - i.e. at what scale does the analog computation end?
